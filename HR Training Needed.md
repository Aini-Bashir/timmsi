## I-9
I-9 is a form used by employers to verify the identity and employment authorization of employees hired in the United States. Employers are required to complete the I-9 form for each employee, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. The form requires employees to provide documents that prove their identity and work eligibility, such as a passport, driver's license, or Social Security card. Employers must verify the documents provided by the employee and record the information on the I-9 form. The I-9 form must be completed within three days of the employee's first day of work, and employers must retain the form for a certain period of time.

## E-Verify
E-Verify is an internet-based system that allows employers to confirm the eligibility of employees to work in the United States. The system compares information from an employee's I-9 form to data from U.S. government records. Employers can use E-Verify voluntarily or may be required to use it by law, depending on their location or industry. E-Verify helps employers ensure that their workforce is authorized to work in the United States and can help prevent the hiring of unauthorized workers.

## SHRM Practices
SHRM Practices are the best practices in human resources identified by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). These practices are based on research, analysis, and collaboration with HR professionals worldwide. SHRM Practices cover a wide range of HR topics, including talent acquisition, employee development, compensation and benefits, and diversity and inclusion. Implementing SHRM Practices can help organizations improve their HR processes and create better workplaces for employees.

## SHRM BASK / BoCK
The SHRM Body of Applied Skills and Knowledge (SHRM BASK), formerly known as the SHRM Body of Competency and Knowledge (SHRM BoCK), is a framework developed by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) that defines the knowledge areas and behavioral competencies required for success in the HR profession. The SHRM BASK includes nine behavioral competencies and one technical competency. The behavioral competencies cover areas such as leadership, communication, and global and cultural effectiveness, while the technical competency covers HR expertise. The SHRM BASK is used as the basis for SHRM's certification exams, the SHRM-CP and SHRM-SCP.

## DE&I Policies
DE&I Policies are policies and practices related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. These policies aim to create a workplace that is fair, inclusive, and welcoming for all employees, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. DE&I Policies may include initiatives such as training on unconscious bias, recruitment and retention programs for underrepresented groups, and employee resource groups. Implementing DE&I Policies can help organizations attract and retain diverse talent, improve employee engagement and productivity, and enhance their reputation as a socially responsible employer.

## Technical Recruiting
Technical recruiting is the process of hiring employees for technical positions, such as software developers, engineers, or data scientists. Technical recruiting often involves using specialized recruiting techniques, such as sourcing candidates through online communities or attending industry events. Technical recruiting also requires an understanding of the technical skills and experience required for the position, as well as the ability to assess a candidate's technical abilities during the hiring process.

## Onboarding
Onboarding is the process of integrating new employees into an organization and providing them with the information and resources they need to be successful in their new role. Onboarding may include orientation sessions, introductions to key team members and stakeholders, and training on company policies and procedures. Effective onboarding can help new employees feel welcomed and supported, reduce turnover, and improve productivity.

## Employee Journey
The Employee Journey is the sum of all experiences an employee has with a company, from the recruitment and hiring process through to their exit from the company. It includes all interactions with the company, including onboarding, ongoing training and development, performance management, compensation and benefits, and career advancement opportunities. Understanding and managing the Employee Journey can improve employee engagement and retention.
