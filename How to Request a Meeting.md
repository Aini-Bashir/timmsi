# How to Request a Meeting

## When asking people to meetings, always include:

## Topic

- Estimated Length of Call

- Attendees Required

- Attendees Optional

## Example:

- Aleem, I'd like a 15-minute meeting with you to discuss who the best bollywood fashion designer is. 

- Rimsha & Ayesha, your input would also be valuable.

- Are you available now? Otherwise I'll put a meeting request in the calendar.
