# Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)
The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) has been serving HR professionals worldwide for over 70 years. SHRM provides comprehensive information and tools to help HR professionals effectively perform their jobs, develop their careers, and transform their organizations to create better workplaces where employers and employees thrive together.

# SHRM Competency Model
In 2011, SHRM initiated a research program to identify the critical competencies needed for success as an HR professional. The program involved thousands of HR professionals from around the world and led to the development of the SHRM Competency Model. The model defined eight key behavioral competencies and one technical competency that are integral to success in HR. The behavioral competencies include Leadership & Navigation, Ethical Practice, Relationship Management, Communication, Global & Cultural Effectiveness, Business Acumen, Consultation, and Critical Evaluation. The technical competency is HR Expertise.

# SHRM Body of Applied Skills and Knowledge (SHRM BASK)
The SHRM Body of Applied Skills and Knowledge (SHRM BASK) is an evolution of the SHRM Competency Model. It further defines the knowledge areas in addition to the behavioral competencies. The SHRM BASK was developed through a series of large-scale research studies that incorporated the viewpoints of thousands of HR professionals worldwide. It was most recently updated in 2021 and now includes nine behavioral competencies and one technical competency.

# SHRM Certification Exams
The SHRM BASK is used not only to describe the HR field but also to define the content areas of SHRM's certification exams: the SHRM Certified Professional (SHRM-CP) exam for HR professionals in operational roles and the SHRM Senior Certified Professional (SHRM-SCP) exam for senior-level HR professionals in strategic roles. These credentials provide reliable indicators to the global business community that the credential-holder is a recognized expert and leader in the HR field with the necessary capabilities in both aspects of HR practice—competencies and knowledge—that are required for effective job performance.

# SHRM Exam Development
The SHRM BASK is the common framework for the item writers who develop SHRM-CP and SHRM-SCP exam questions, as well as individuals and organizations developing exam preparation materials. SHRM's own operations for exam development are separate and independent from its operations for study material development. SHRM observes a strict firewall between these activities to protect the integrity and credibility of the certification exams.
